# javascript-chess-ai

A very basic implementation of a AI for playing chess.

Libraries: 
- Vanilla JS

# Installation
npm i

run with some simple server ( like [simple-http-server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) )

Not sure where this is going, or what ML libraries, if any it will use, but it's a fun project.
